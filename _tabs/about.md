# ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

I'm Jordan Aguilar (aka. [Flygerth](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/1384315){:target="_blank"}), a student and cybersecurity enthusiast passionate about learning new technologies in order to develop professionally. Experienced in controlled environments such as Hack The Box or CTF's.
Currently preparing for the [PNPT](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pnpt/){:target="_blank"}, I have created this website to share with you my knowledge in cybersecurity and document the machines I am doing in the form of **Writeup's**.

I hope you like my page, there will be a lot of useful information to nurture your knowledge. I'll be posting my writeups, hacking notes and other things related to the subject.
